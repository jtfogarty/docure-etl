Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed markdown explanation of how the `searchSpeeches` method in `typesense.ts` handles the case when `playId` is `'all'` versus when it is a specific play ID. This will also cover how the `SearchResult` promise is populated in each scenario.

# `searchSpeeches` Method Overview

The `searchSpeeches` method is designed to search for speeches based on a given `searchText` and `playId`. It handles two scenarios: when `playId` is set to `'all'` and when it is a specific play ID. The method returns a `Promise<SearchResult>` containing the relevant data.

## Case 1: `playId` is `'all'`

### Flow:
1. **Fetch All Plays, Acts, and Scenes**:
   - The method calls `fetchAllPlays()`, `fetchAllActs()`, and `fetchAllScenes()` to retrieve all plays, acts, and scenes from the database.
   - These methods perform database queries to gather all relevant data without any filtering.

2. **Search for All Speeches**:
   - The method calls `searchAllSpeeches(searchText)` to search for speeches across all documents in the `speeches` collection, using the provided `searchText`.
   - This search does not filter by play, allowing it to return speeches from any play.

3. **Populate `SearchResult`**:
   - The `SearchResult` object is constructed with the following properties:
     - `play`: An object indicating that all plays are included (`{ id: 'all', title: 'All Plays' }`).
     - `acts`: The array of all acts fetched.
     - `scenes`: The array of all scenes fetched.
     - `characters`: An empty array (assuming no specific character data is needed).
     - `speeches`: The array of speeches returned from the search.
     - `found`: The total number of speeches found.
     - `page`: The current page number.
     - `total_pages`: The total number of pages calculated based on the number of speeches found.

### Example of `SearchResult` Structure:
```json
{
  "play": { "id": "all", "title": "All Plays" },
  "acts": [...], // Array of all acts
  "scenes": [...], // Array of all scenes
  "characters": [], // Empty array
  "speeches": [...], // Array of speeches found
  "found": 100, // Total speeches found
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 10
}
```

## Case 2: `playId` is a Specific Play ID

### Flow:
1. **Fetch Specific Play Details**:
   - The method calls `fetchPlayDetails(playId)` to retrieve details for the specific play identified by `playId`.
   - This includes fetching associated acts, scenes, and characters for that play.

2. **Search for Speeches by Play ID**:
   - The method calls `searchSpeechesByPlayId(searchText, playId)` to search for speeches that belong to the specific play.
   - This search filters the results based on the provided `playId`, ensuring that only speeches from that play are returned.

3. **Populate `SearchResult`**:
   - The `SearchResult` object is constructed with the following properties:
     - `play`: The details of the specific play fetched.
     - `acts`: The array of acts associated with the specific play.
     - `scenes`: The array of scenes associated with the specific play.
     - `characters`: The array of characters associated with the specific play.
     - `speeches`: The array of speeches returned from the search.
     - `found`: The total number of speeches found for that play.
     - `page`: The current page number.
     - `total_pages`: The total number of pages calculated based on the number of speeches found.

### Example of `SearchResult` Structure:
```json
{
  "play": { "id": "specificPlayId", "title": "Specific Play Title" },
  "acts": [...], // Array of acts for the specific play
  "scenes": [...], // Array of scenes for the specific play
  "characters": [...], // Array of characters for the specific play
  "speeches": [...], // Array of speeches found for the specific play
  "found": 50, // Total speeches found for the specific play
  "page": 1,
  "total_pages": 5
}
```

## Summary

- When `playId` is `'all'`, the method retrieves all plays, acts, scenes, and speeches, returning a comprehensive `SearchResult` that encompasses all available data.
- When `playId` is a specific ID, the method fetches only the relevant details for that play, including associated acts, scenes, characters, and speeches, resulting in a more focused `SearchResult`.

This design allows for flexible searching across all plays or specific plays, catering to different user needs while maintaining a consistent structure for the returned data.
